 ## Briefly About Myself:

 Hello, I am a Front End developer with knowledge of various development tools.

 For the last 4 years I have studied as a software engineer-economist. As a result, I chose the direction of Front-End development and really want to apply my skills to commercial projects.
 
 Very interesting in working with creative teams who are going to create something new and wonderful, working in a comfortable team-oriented environment.
